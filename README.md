## Library Work with .Net Core 

I developed this website while working with .NET Core MVC. This is the V1 version of the project, and it includes the following features:

- Working with simple data without a database.
- An example project for those who work with .NET Core MVC, like myself.
- It includes basic functionalities such as adding, removing, updating, and deleting products.

Any kind of feedback is important to me. This is an simple project for those who want to improve themselves with .Net Core MVC.

Once I prepare other versions, I will share them in a separate repository.
